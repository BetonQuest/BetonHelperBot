# BetonHelperBot

This is a discord bot that will help you creating Quests with [BetonQuest](https://github.com/Co0sh/BetonQuest).  
He is synchronizing the  [wiki](https://github.com/Co0sh/BetonQuest/wiki) to provide you fast access to any information that is written there.

**The bot is heavily inspired by the BetonQuestBot of @CalebGitBritannia.**


## Adding the bot to your server:

You can add the bot account to your discord server, just click on [this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=494162764403572748&scope=bot&permissions=216064).

Note that I host this on my small, private, self paid server, so there might be some downtimes or performance issues.

## Hosting the bot:

If you wan't more control and reliability I advise you to host the bot on your own server.  
You find the latest release of the bot [here]() and a super simple start script [here]().  
The bot will restart every night at 04:20.

You will need to register an account for the bot and specify it's authentication token inside the `AUTH_TOKEN.txt` file, a guide how to do this can be found [here](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token).
